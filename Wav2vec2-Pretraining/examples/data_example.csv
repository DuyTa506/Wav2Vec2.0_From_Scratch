/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0000-norm.wav	9.915	shortly after passing one of these chapels we came suddenly upon a village which started up out of the mist and i was alarmed lest i should be made an object of curiosity or dislike
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0001-norm.wav	9.75	my guides however were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience but they could not help eyeing me nor i them
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0002-norm.wav	4.055	the streets were narrow and unpaved but very fairly clean
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0003-norm.wav	8.15	the vine grew outside many of the houses and there were some with sign boards on which was painted a bottle and a glass that made me feel much at home
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0004-norm.wav	10.41	even on this ledge of human society there was a stunted growth of shoplets which had taken root and vegetated somehow though as in an air mercantile of the bleakest
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0005-norm.wav	5.845	each feature was finished eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0006-norm.wav	10.22	their expression was divine and as they glanced at me timidly but with parted lips in great bewilderment i forgot all thoughts of their conversion in feelings that were far more earthly
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0007-norm.wav	8.43	even in middle age they were still comely and the old grey haired women at their cottage doors had a dignity not to say majesty of their own
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0008-norm.wav	2.735	the men were as handsome as the women beautiful
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0009-norm.wav	10.42	i have always delighted in and reverenced beauty but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type a compound of all that is best in egyptian greek and italian
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0010-norm.wav	7.94	the children were infinite in number and exceedingly merry i need hardly say that they came in for their full share of the prevailing beauty
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0011-norm.wav	5.935	i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0012-norm.wav	8.12	the country was highly cultivated every ledge being planted with chestnuts walnuts and apple trees from which the apples were now gathering
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0013-norm.wav	3.915	i saw a few sheep with rounded noses and enormous tails
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0014-norm.wav	17.615	in about four hours of walking from the time we started and after passing two or three more villages we came upon a considerable town and my guides made many attempts to make me understand something but i gathered no inkling of their meaning except that i need be under no apprehension of danger
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0015-norm.wav	11.39	suffice it that i found myself taken before the chief magistrate and by his orders was placed in an apartment with two other people who were the first i had seen looking anything but well and handsome
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0016-norm.wav	8.44	in fact one of them was plainly very much out of health and coughed violently from time to time in spite of manifest efforts to suppress it
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0017-norm.wav	6.99	the other looked pale and ill but he was marvellously self contained and it was impossible to say what was the matter with him
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0018-norm.wav	12.105	they felt my pulse they looked at my tongue they listened at my chest they felt all my muscles and at the end of each operation they looked at the chief and nodded and said something in a tone quite pleasant as though i were all right
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0019-norm.wav	7.485	but by and by they came to my watch which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket that i had and had forgotten when they began their search
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0020-norm.wav	7.975	again there was a very old carriage whose wheels in spite of rust and decay i could see had been designed originally for iron rails
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0021-norm.wav	6.11	we passed many cases and at last came to one in which there were several clocks and two or three old watches
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0022-norm.wav	3.54	the design was different but the thing was clearly the same
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0023-norm.wav	2.65	this had some effect in calming him
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153954/2412-153954-0024-norm.wav	4.19	he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kinder manner
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0000-norm.wav	11.66	if the reader will excuse me i will say nothing of my antecedents nor of the circumstances which led me to leave my native country the narrative would be tedious to him and painful to myself
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0001-norm.wav	10.51	it will be seen that i did not succeed in my design and that however much i may have met with that was new and strange i have been unable to reap any pecuniary advantage
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0002-norm.wav	3.72	no one who is himself honest will doubt my being so
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0003-norm.wav	8.515	i reached my destination in one of the last months of eighteen sixty eight but i dare not mention the season lest the reader should gather in which hemisphere i was
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0004-norm.wav	22.68	sheep and cattle were introduced and bred with extreme rapidity men took up their fifty thousand or one hundred thousand acres of country going inland one behind the other till in a few years there was not an acre between the sea and the front ranges which was not taken up and stations either for sheep or cattle were spotted about at intervals of some twenty or thirty miles over the whole country
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0005-norm.wav	3.14	i was delighted with the country and the manner of life
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0006-norm.wav	16.615	i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand nor to get them in a single mob but to see enough of them here and there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong this was no difficult matter for there were not above eight hundred of them and being all breeding ewes they were pretty quiet
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0007-norm.wav	9.37	there were a good many sheep which i knew as two or three black ewes and a black lamb or two and several others which had some distinguishing mark whereby i could tell them
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0008-norm.wav	5.815	it is surprising how soon the eye becomes accustomed to missing twenty sheep out of two or three hundred
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0009-norm.wav	5.995	it was a monotonous life but it was very healthy and one does not much mind anything when one is well
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0010-norm.wav	2.915	the country was the grandest that can be imagined
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0011-norm.wav	9.7450625	so lonely and so solemn with the sad grey clouds above and no sound save a lost lamb bleating upon the mountain side as though its little heart were breaking
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0012-norm.wav	6.17	each must cry louder and wander farther yet may luck be with them both that they may find their own at nightfall
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0013-norm.wav	8.54	i had no money but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0014-norm.wav	9.705	there was no one in the whole world who had the smallest idea save those who were themselves on the other side of it if indeed there was any one at all could i hope to cross it
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153948/2412-153948-0015-norm.wav	3.465	i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0000-norm.wav	2.55	preface to second edition
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0001-norm.wav	3.225	this is a mistake though a perfectly natural one
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0002-norm.wav	6.595	on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0003-norm.wav	9.515	then i had much pleasure in reading it but was indeed surprised at the many little points of similarity between the two books in spite of their entire independence to one another
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0004-norm.wav	8.72	i regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on machines as an attempt to reduce mister darwin's theory to an absurdity
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0005-norm.wav	13.68	i am surprised however that the book at which such an example of the specious misuse of analogy would seem most naturally levelled should have occurred to no reviewer neither shall i mention the name of the book here though i should fancy that the hint given will suffice
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0006-norm.wav	11.68	but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for i was allowed almost to call them life long self deceivers to their faces and they said it was quite true but that it did not matter
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0007-norm.wav	8.735	i must not conclude without expressing my most sincere thanks to my critics and to the public for the leniency and consideration with which they have treated my adventures

/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0009-norm.wav	8.72	i also wrote about this time the substance of what ultimately became the musical banks and the trial of a man for being in a consumption
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0010-norm.wav	17.1950625	i see from my second preface that i took the book to messrs chapman and hall may first eighteen seventy one and on their rejection of it under the advice of one who has attained the highest rank among living writers i let it sleep till i took it to mister trubner early in eighteen seventy two
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0011-norm.wav	10.13	i attribute its unlooked for success mainly to two early favourable reviews the first in the pall mall gazette of april twelfth and the second in the spectator of april twentieth
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0012-norm.wav	1.98	there was also another cause

/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0014-norm.wav	12.795	i made a few further very trifling alterations before moulds were taken but since the summer of eighteen seventy two as new editions were from time to time wanted they have been printed from stereos then made
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0015-norm.wav	11.03	i am still fairly well satisfied with those parts of erewhon that were repeatedly rewritten but from those that had only a single writing i would gladly cut out some forty or fifty pages if i could
/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2412/153947/2412-153947-0016-norm.wav	5.185	this however may not be for the copyright will probably expire in a little over twelve years
